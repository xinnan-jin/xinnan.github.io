I am a PhD student and bioinformatician at [IMB](https://imb.uq.edu.au/) within the University of Queensland and the [QIMR Berghofer](https://www.qimrberghofer.edu.au/), working under the supervision of Dr Quan Nguyen. 

My research focuses on developing methods for statistically identifying rare cell types through statistical and deep lerning methods, as well as exploring the complexities of skin cancer through the integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics, and multi-omics approaches. 

I will complete my third progress review in June 2025 and am actively seeking an job, preferably in Sydney or the surrounding area.
