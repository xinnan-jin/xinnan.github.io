I am a PhD student and bioinformatician at [IMB](https://imb.uq.edu.au/) within the University of Queensland and affiliated with [QIMR Berghofer](https://www.qimrberghofer.edu.au/), under the supervision of Associate Professor Quan Nguyen. My research interest includes computational biology, multi-omics. My research project focuses on identify rare cell types from single-cell omics and spatial transcriptomics though statistic and deep learning methods.
